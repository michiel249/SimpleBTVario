# SimpleBTVario
Simple Bluetooth Vario (Arduino + MS5611 barometric pressure sensor) with LK8000 bluetooth sentences

Forked from Vario by D.Felix (https://codebender.cc/sketch:34645#Vario.ino)

## Differences from original:
 + Use of MS5611 sensor instead of BMP085
 + Use of a button to set to sleep/awake the ÂµP
 + Use of the native arduino tone functions (compatibility with ARM Cortex M0)
 
## :information_source: Compatibility with ARM Cortex M0 in progess
